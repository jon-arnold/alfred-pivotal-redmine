# Alfred Workflow
## Pivotal and Redmine

1. "rm foo" gets you the redmine project 'foo'.
2. "rm# 12345" gets you the redmine issue 12345.
3. "piv# 12345" gets you the pivotal ticket 12345.
4. "piv" opens your pivotal projects list.

Easy enough. If you have [Alfred 2 with Powerpack](http://www.alfredapp.com/powerpack/), just open the file and it will install into your Alfred Preferences.
